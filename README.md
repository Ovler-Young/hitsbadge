## Usage

Insert the badge in your markdown like so:

```md
![hits](https://hitsbadge.vercel.app/api/badge?id=my-awesome-project)
```

Replacing `my-awesome-project` with a unique ID for your thing.

It could be a project repo, or even your personal README to count hits on
your profile.

## Thanks

This project was inspired by [visitor-badge](https://github.com/jwenjian/visitor-badge) and [HITS](https://github.com/dwyl/hits) which are both great
but unfortunately seem to be having hosting issues.

It also uses Wenjian Jiang's awesome [countapi](https://countapi.xyz).
